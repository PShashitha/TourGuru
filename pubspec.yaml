  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:

     - assets/
     - assets/3dModelAtGeoLocation/
     - assets/3dModelAtGeoLocation/js/
     - assets/3dModelAtGeoLocation/css/
     - assets/3dModelAtGeoLocation/assets/
     - assets/3dModelOnPlane/
     - assets/3dModelOnPlane/assets/
     - assets/3dModelOnPlane/assets/buttons/
     - assets/3dModelOnPlane/assets/models/
     - assets/3dModelOnPlane/jquery/
     - assets/3dModelOnPlane/jquery/images/
     - assets/3dModelOnPlane/js/
     - assets/3dModelOnPlane/css/
     - assets/BrowsingPois/
     - assets/BrowsingPois/assets/
     - assets/BrowsingPois/jquery/
     - assets/BrowsingPois/jquery/images/
     - assets/BrowsingPois/js/
     - assets/BrowsingPois/css/
     

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
